## [1.1.0] - 2017-08-13
### Added
- âœ¨ Automatic trimming of all leading and trailing whitespace. Some IDE's (like Atom) add a trailing empty line at the end of a file. If you opened a CSV and saved it over, such IDE's would a trailing empty line. `csv-split-easy` automatically trims all whitespace in front and in the end of an incoming string now, so such whitespace should not be an issue now.
